# Getting started with the product platform

## Overview

In this guide you will learn how to set up your local environment for developing the product platform (codename Birdleaf) for the first time. By the end of this tutorial you will have everything you need to build, run, and test Birdleaf services on your machine. 

## What you'll need

**Birdleaf Repository**

First you'll need to clone the GitHub repository onto your machine.

```bash

  git clone https://github.com/milescjohnson/birdleaf.git

```

**.NET SDK**

Birdleaf is build using [.NET 7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0). You'll need to download and install it to build and run the code. You can verify from the command line with:

```
  dotnet --version

```

**Editor or IDE**

You can use whatever IDE or editor you would like, but [Rider](), [VS Code](), or [VisualStudio] are recommended for .NET.
