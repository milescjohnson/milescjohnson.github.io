Over the course of 10 years as a backend engineer I have written, and read, a lot of technical documents. I have learned to appreciate how powerful great documentation is, and how miserable it is working with poor documentation. I take pride in creating clear, accessible, and useful resources for both technical and non-technical audiences.

Here are a few sample projects to demonstrate documentation style and skills:  

## 1047 Games

Shortly after I joined 1047 Games, they announced internally that we would begin working on a sequel to their flagship game. I was part of a handful of engineers tasked with breaking ground on a brand new backend platform for the new game. In additon to developing the foundational systems and services of the new backend, we were responsible for writing knowledgebase articles, design documents, and API references for everything we built. While these documents are not publicly available, I have created a few samples to represent the kinds of documents I would write for internal engineering teams.

## Knowhere

At Knowhere, we had a rich dataset of NLP data for current event news articles for things like factual accuracy, rhetorical sentiment analysis, and bias. We used this data internally to create a daily newsletter focused on transparent impartial journalism. We also developed APIs for external use. I have created a sample for such an API reference.

I was also responsible for developing and optimizing our email newsletter delivery system. One such optimization I implemented was using a Thompson Sampling algorithm to optimize open-rate by email subject line. Here is a blog-style document explaining this algorithm and use-case to a non-technical audience.
